# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a Bioinformatics programmer with a Master's Degree in Computational Life Sciences. I work in the Pediatrics Department of University of California San Diego's School of Medicine researching the lung using spatial epigenomics. We are developing the first open access dataset of single nucleus RNAseq and ATACseq normal human lung samples. Outside of work, my hobbies are reading, hiking, and rock climbing.
