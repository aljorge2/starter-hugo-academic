## Biography 
{style="color: #F76497"}
My name is Annika Jorgensen I am currently a Master's student at Arizona State University studying Computational Life Science. My Bachelor's degree is in Biophysics from Arizona State University. I currently and researching sex differential in sex chromosomes and helping develop a CURE (Course Based Undergraduate Research Experience) at ASU and researching student engagement within that class. My career goal is to become a bioinformatician in industry.

 I have been teaching for seven years. I ran a preschool class for one and have been teaching kids in how to read for five years. I have also been a TA for graduate level classes for two years. I enjoyed teaching because I have always enjoyed getting people excited about learning. I started teaching by becoming a tutor at a company and running a preschool class at their center. I then transferred to Kumon as a tutor where I worked there for four years teaching kids how to read.

Below is a list of courses that I have either a teaching assistant for and materials I have made for said courses.


**Teaching Assistant for Research Computing**
{style="color: #3CB5B5"}
I was a TA twice for an online graduate course titled Computing for Research. The clas taught students command line and a bioinformatics pipline for genomic analysis. The course had 250 students. My goal was to answer students questions on Slack, hold 2-3 hours of Office Hours and attend weekly TA meetings.

**Teaching Assistant for Genomics Research Experience**
{style="color: #3CB5B5"}
I was a TA for a online CURE titled Genomic Research Experience. The class taught students the coding language R as well as walked through through a research question involving identifying sex of cell lines through gene expression. THe course had 52 students. My goal was to answer students questions through Slack, hold 2 hours of Office Hours, attend additonal weekly 2 hours worth of meeting with the students, and attend weekly TA meetings, grade students assignments, and subsequently analyze student enagement with the course.
