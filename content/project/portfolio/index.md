## Overview
This project details my teaching portfolio. This portfolio lists my teaching experience and abilities as well as my values and philosophy. This portfolio also lists how my experiences and approach have developed over time. For more information vist the website linked at the top of this page. 

## Biography 
My name is Annika Jorgensen I am currently a Master's student at Arizona State University studying Computational Life Science. My Bachelor's degree is in Biophysics from Arizona State University. I currently and researching sex differential in sex chromosomes and helping develop a CURE (Course Based Undergraduate Research Experience) at ASU and researching student engagement within that class. My career goal is to become a bioinformatician in industry.

 I have been teaching for seven years. I ran a preschool class for one and have been teaching kids in how to read for five years. I have also been a TA for graduate level classes for two years. I enjoyed teaching because I have always enjoyed getting people excited about learning. I started teaching by becoming a tutor at a company and running a preschool class at their center. I then transferred to Kumon as a tutor where I worked there for four years teaching kids how to read.
